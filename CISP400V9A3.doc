A3
Create a GradeBook class that calculates a grade-point average for a set of grades and displays information. You can input A, a, B, b, C, c, D, d, F and f for grades.  But the inputted data could also be any characters, upper case, lower case or special character.  The system should detect an improper grade input and allow reentering information.  The grade of A is worth 4 points, B is worth 3 points, etc.    You can use GradeBook program of Fig. 5.9–Fig. 5.11(attached) as a starting point.   

The GradeBook class has the following methods and attributes.
1.	The GradeBook class has 3 private data members, courseName, letterGrades and countGrades.
a.	The courseName has a string data type.  It stores course name information.
b.	The letterGrades is a 100 elements character array.  It stores all the inputs information which include the letter grades and non-letter grade information. For example, if you put a, $, a, C, 1, ! for the first 6 inputs the letterGrades first six elements should store A, $, A, C, 1, !.
c.	The countGrades is a 6 elements integer array.  It stores the number of each letter grade and number of the error(s) input.  For example, if you input 5 As, 6 Bs, 1 C, 2 Ds, 2 Es and 3 Fs, the countGrades array elements from 0 to 5 should contain 5, 6, 1, 2, 3 and 2.

2.	It also has several public member functions, GradeBook, setCourseName, getCourseName, initializeData, displayMessage, inputGrades, displayGradeReport, displayInputs, calculateGrade and ~GradeBook.
a.	The GradeBook function is a constructor.  It takes a string and will initialize its data members’ data.   The constructor also displays information which includes “The Grade Book Constructor is called", “*****The end of Grade Book Constructor.*****”  and the information in between these two statements.
b.	The setCourseName function takes a string and does not return anything.  This function sets information for the string private data, courseName.  It takes only the first 30 characters of the input string.  If the inputted string shorter than 30 it will take everything.  If it is longer than 30 it will keep the first 30 characters and truncate the rest of the information.
c.	The getCourseName function returns the private data, courseName, information.  It does not accept any data.
d.	The initializeData function does not take and return anything.  It initializes the private data members. 
e.	The displayMessage function does not take and return anything.  It displays "Welcome to the grade book for      " information.
f.	The inputGrades function does not take and return anything.  It generates loops to get any number(but it need to be less than 100) of proper data input.  If the inputted data is not any one of the following A, a, B, b, C, c, E, d, F, and f, the program will show “****Incorrect letter grade entered.****” message.  The loop will be ended by inputting Ctl + D, or Ctl + Z ( it depends on your computer system).
g.	The displayGradeReport function does not accept and return any data. It displays   “The total number of students receive grades is ", "Number of students who received each letter grade” and “The class average is’ information.  The class average is displayed in one digit double value. 
h.	The displayInputs function does not accept and return any data. It displays “The data entered is listed at the following: " as a heading and all the grades (information) entered in a 4 in a row tabulate format.
i.	The calculateGrade function does not accept any data but return a double value.  This function calculates the GPA (Grade Point Average) and return the data.
j.	i.The  ~GradeBook function is the destructor of the class.  When it called it will clean up the memory and displays “Destructor is called” message.

This assignment comes with a CISP400V9A3.zip file.  It includes four files (CISP400V9A3.cpp, CISP400V9A3.exe, GradeBook.cpp and GradeBook.h).  The CISP400V9A3.exe file is an executable file.  You can double click the file to get to the expecting result (see the picture below) of this assignment.  The GradeBook.cpp and GradeBook.h are files coming from the textbook examples (Fig 5.9 and 5.10) which you can use so you don’t need to start from scratch.

Create a GradeBook class that takes grades and student names and displays information in an arrange way.   The program also calculates a grade-point average for the inputted grades. You can input A, a, B, b, C, c, D, d, F and f for grades.  But the inputted data could also be any characters, upper case, lower case or special character.  The system should detect an improper grade input and allow reentering information.  The grade of A is worth 4 points, B is worth 3 points, etc.    You can use GradeBook program of Fig. 5.9–Fig. 5.11(attached) as a starting point.   

The GradeBook class has the following methods and attributes.
1.	The GradeBook class has 4 private data members, courseName, letterGrades, countGrades, and studentName.
a.	The courseName has a string data type.  It stores course name information.
b.	The letterGrades is a 100 elements character array.  It stores all the inputs information which include the letter grades and non-letter grade information. For example, if you put a, $, a, C, 1, ! for the first 6 inputs the letterGrades first six elements should store A, $, A, C, 1, !.
c.	The countGrades is a 6 elements integer array.  It stores the number of each letter grade and number of the error(s) input.  For example, if you input 5 As, 6 Bs, 1 C, 2 Ds, 2 Es and 3 Fs, the countGrades array elements from 0 to 5 should contain 5, 6, 1, 2, 3 and 2.
